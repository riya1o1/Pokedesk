# 🧩 Pokedesk – Catch & Collect Pokémon (WIP)

A fun Pokédex web app where users can **browse, catch, and collect Pokémon**, built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project will later include **machine learning features** like Pokémon image recognition using Teachable Machine and TensorFlow.js.

> 🚧 **Status:** Project just started (WIP – Work in Progress)

---

## 📌 Goals

- Display a list of Pokémon using the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
- Add a "Catch" feature with random success
- Show caught Pokémon in a personal collection (saved using localStorage)
- Integrate ML for Pokémon recognition via image upload (future)
- Add voice commands to catch Pokémon (optional feature)
